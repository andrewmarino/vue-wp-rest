# vue-wp-rest

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

_*`npm run build` does not currently work because webpack expects index.html rather than index.php_.

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
